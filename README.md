## About me

My approach to work

- Develop shared mental models (you, coworkers, customers)
- Invert your org chart - management serves you 
- We are systems designers so become familiar w/ systems
- Helping customers solve problems creates perception of value
- Max economic value gets priority (cost of delay)
- Great product >= great engineering
- Prioritize healthy living  
- Certainty: Death, taxes _and constant change_ so maximize knowledge creation via {theory/experiment/feedback} loop
- Confusing UX is a priority bug
- Generalist > Specialist (usually)
- Remote-first mindset
